## 1. Social Media Integration
### Title: Integrate Meta Graph API for Unified Native Social Media Inbox
**Problem Statement**: Small business owners like Maya (The Home Baker) receive orders and inquiries across Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Managing these manually is overwhelming and leads to missed sales. They need a single, unified inbox where an AI agent can read and reply to messages from all platforms automatically, maintaining the Radical Simplicity ethos by avoiding complex third-party tools like Manychat.

**Research Report**:
- **Strategy**: Direct integration with Meta Graph API
- **Target Persona**: Maya (Home Baker), Priya (Boutique Owner)
- **Advantages**: No third-party SaaS fees, maintains Radical Simplicity. Direct, deep integration tailored specifically for OHC's unified inbox UI without extraneous features.
- **Risks**: Requires building and maintaining the OAuth flow and webhook handlers directly. Meta's API reviews can be stringent.
- **Pricing**: Free API usage.
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (via webhooks/OAuth). Standalone (requires routing via a lightweight cloud proxy).

**Design Doc**:
- User goes to the Operations dashboard and clicks "Connect Instagram".
- User authenticates with Facebook/Instagram via OAuth.
- OHC registers webhooks to receive new DMs.
- When a DM arrives, the Customer Success agent reads it, generates a reply (e.g., "Yes, we do vegan cakes!"), and sends it back via Meta Graph API.
- The user sees a unified "Customer Inbox" on their phone showing the conversation history.
- **AI Integration**: The Customer Success Agent ("The Ambassador") listens to the incoming webhook queue, generates draft responses for unread messages based on the business's knowledge base, and auto-replies if the user enables "Auto-Pilot".

**Implementation Prompt**: Implement a direct Meta Graph API OAuth flow. Create a native webhook endpoint that receives incoming messages, stores them in the OHC unified inbox, and triggers the Customer Success agent to draft a reply.

## 2. Calendar & Scheduling
### Title: Native Calendar Sync for Automated Booking
**Problem Statement**: Service providers like Carlos (Handyman) and Leo (Music Tutor) lose time going back and forth over email/text to find a time to meet. They need a way for customers to simply click a link, see available times, and book a slot directly synchronized with their existing Google Calendar or Apple Calendar, without confusing third-party scheduling tools like Calendly.

**Research Report**:
- **Strategy**: Direct Google Calendar API / CalDAV integration
- **Target Persona**: Carlos (Handyman), Leo (Music Tutor)
- **Advantages**: Zero configuration needed beyond logging in. Avoids confusing users with Calendly setups. Fully integrated into OHC's existing booking flow.
- **Risks**: Handling complex timezone logic internally.
- **Pricing**: Free API usage.
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (OAuth). Standalone (OAuth).

**Design Doc**:
- User goes to Sales dashboard and connects their Google account.
- OHC reads busy blocks directly from Google Calendar to calculate availability for predefined event types (e.g., "30-min Consultation").
- When a customer clicks to book, they use OHC's native booking widget.
- Upon successful booking, OHC pushes the event directly to Google Calendar and records the appointment in the Operations dashboard.
- **AI Integration**: The Operations Agent monitors the calendar and alerts the business owner if they have back-to-back appointments without buffer times, suggesting schedule optimizations.

**Implementation Prompt**: Create a native booking widget and Google Calendar OAuth integration. Calculate availability based on existing calendar events and sync new bookings directly to Google Calendar.
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated Scope**: Medium

## 3. Email Marketing
### Title: Scout 🔍: Integrate Resend for AI-Powered Email Marketing
**Problem Statement**: Business owners like Priya want to notify their existing customers about new stock or holiday sales. Traditional tools like Mailchimp are too complex and require manual template design, list management, and campaign scheduling.

**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Resend.
- **Evaluation**: Resend provides a developer-friendly, reliable email API. Instead of giving users a complex drag-and-drop builder, OHC can use the "Marketing" AI agent to generate beautiful HTML emails based on a simple text prompt from the user.
- **Ease of Use**: Zero-friction. The user types "Tell my customers about the new summer dress collection," and the AI generates the subject line, body, and inserts product photos automatically.
- **Pricing**: Resend charges around $20/mo for up to 50k emails, very economical to bundle into an OHC premium tier.
- **Cloud vs. Standalone**: Cloud mode uses OHC's centralized Resend account. Standalone mode requires the user to input their own SMTP credentials.

**Design Doc**:
- "Marketing" tab -> "Send a Broadcast".
- User provides a 1-sentence prompt.
- The AI Agent generates a responsive HTML email preview.
- User clicks "Send to all customers".
- The system chunks the customer list and sends via the Resend API.

**Implementation Prompt**: Create a feature where the user can prompt the AI to draft an email blast. Use the business's product catalog to enrich the email. Provide a preview UI. Once approved, queue the emails to be sent out via the Resend API to all opted-in customers, handling rate limits and basic bounce tracking.
**Priority**: P2
**Estimated Scope**: Medium

## 4. Payment Processing
### Title: Integrate Mercado Pago for LATAM Payments
**Problem Statement**: Small business owners in Latin America cannot easily use Stripe and need a trusted local payment processor to accept credit cards and local methods like Pix or Pago Fácil.

**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Mercado Pago
- **Target Persona**: Global users outside the US/EU.
- **Advantages**: Dominant in LATAM. Supports local payment methods (Pix in Brazil, OXXO in Mexico). Good developer docs.
- **Risks**: Settlement times can be longer. API is slightly less standardized than Stripe.
- **Pricing**: Variable by country (e.g., ~4-5% per transaction).
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (OAuth). Standalone (API Key).

**Design Doc**:
- User selects their country during onboarding. If LATAM, Mercado Pago is offered alongside Stripe.
- User connects their Mercado Pago account.
- Customers see a "Pay with Mercado Pago" button at checkout.
- Webhooks update the order status in OHC when payment succeeds.

**Implementation Prompt**: Add Mercado Pago as a secondary payment provider. Implement the checkout flow to redirect to Mercado Pago and handle the success/failure webhooks to update order status.
**Priority**: P2
**Estimated Scope**: Large

## 5. Shipping & Logistics
### Title: Integrate Shippo for Automated Label Generation
**Problem Statement**: Priya (Boutique Owner) spends hours copying and pasting addresses into carrier websites to print shipping labels. She needs to click one button in OHC to buy and print a label.

**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Shippo
- **Target Persona**: Priya (Boutique Owner), Maya (Home Baker)
- **Advantages**: Aggregates rates from USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL. Simple API. No monthly fee for pay-as-you-go.
- **Risks**: International shipping requires complex customs declarations which might be hard to automate fully for non-technical users.
- **Pricing**: Free tier (pay per label + postage).
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (OAuth). Standalone (API Key).

**Design Doc**:
- When an order is placed, OHC sends the dimensions/weight to Shippo to get rates.
- The Operations agent shows the cheapest shipping option.
- The user clicks "Buy Label", and OHC downloads the PDF label for printing.
- OHC automatically emails the customer the tracking number.

**Implementation Prompt**: Connect the Shippo API to fetch shipping rates based on order weight/dimensions. Allow the user to purchase a label and automatically email the tracking link to the customer.
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated Scope**: Large

## 6. SMS & Notifications
### Title: Integrate Twilio for SMS Order Notifications
**Problem Statement**: Fatima (Food Cart Operator) relies on her phone for everything and might miss app push notifications in a noisy environment. She needs reliable SMS alerts when a new pre-order arrives so she can start cooking.

**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Twilio
- **Target Persona**: Fatima (Food Cart Operator)
- **Advantages**: Global coverage, incredibly reliable. Programmable messaging.
- **Risks**: A2P 10DLC compliance in the US is complex and requires business registration, which might be a barrier for informal businesses.
- **Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go (~$0.0079 per SMS in US).
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (Centralized OHC Twilio account). Standalone (User provides API key).

**Design Doc**:
- User goes to Settings and toggles "Send me SMS for new orders".
- When an order is paid, the Operations agent triggers a Twilio API call to send an SMS: "New order! 2x Falafel for John. Pickup in 15m."
- (Future: Customers can also receive SMS receipts).

**Implementation Prompt**: Integrate the Twilio SDK to send outbound SMS notifications. Add a setting for the business owner to opt-in to SMS alerts for new orders. Ensure compliance with local messaging regulations.
**Priority**: P2
**Estimated Scope**: Medium

## 7. Video Conferencing
### Title: Integrate Zoom for Auto-Generated Meeting Links
**Problem Statement**: Leo (Music Tutor) manually creates a Zoom link for every new lesson and emails it to the student. This is prone to error and looks unprofessional. He needs links to be generated automatically when a lesson is booked.

**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Zoom
- **Target Persona**: Leo (Music Tutor)
- **Advantages**: Ubiquitous for online lessons. Strong API for meeting creation.
- **Risks**: Zoom OAuth requires annual app review and compliance checks.
- **Pricing**: Free tier (40-min limit). Pro starts at $15/mo.
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (OAuth). Standalone (Server-to-Server OAuth).

**Design Doc**:
- User connects their Zoom account via the Sales dashboard.
- When a customer books an online service (e.g., via Calendly or native booking), OHC calls the Zoom API to create a meeting.
- The Zoom link is embedded in the automated calendar invite and confirmation email sent to the customer.

**Implementation Prompt**: Create an OAuth integration with Zoom. Automatically generate a unique Zoom meeting link when a customer books a virtual service, and include this link in the customer's confirmation email.
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated Scope**: Medium
