  ## 3. Track 3: OHC Gap & Pain Point Identification

  ### OHC Feature Audit
  OHC has a robust **KAIROS** orchestration engine and specialized services (`booking`, `quoting`, `pos`, `delivery`). However, it lacks the "Zero-to-One" autonomous experience found in Durable and the deep "Invisible Automation" of HubSpot Breeze.

  ### Gap Matrix

  | Feature | Shopify Sidekick | Durable AI | **OHC (Current)** | **OHC (Mission)** |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Setup Time** | Days | < 1 Minute | 1 Hour (Manual) | **< 10 Minutes (Agentic)** |
  | **Daily Ops** | Dashboard-first | Simple List | Service-first | **Assistant-first (Feed)** |
  | **Client Intake** | Manual Forms | Basic Leads | Widget-based | **Autonomous Negotiator** |
  | **Inventory** | Manual Sync | Manual | Database-backed | **Predictive Auto-restock** |

  ## 4. Track 4: Deeper Focused Research & Agentic Solutions

  ### Persona Pain Points & Structured Issue Briefs

  #### Mission 1: Zero-Click Onboarding Agent
  - **Title:** Implement Zero-Click Onboarding Agent for OHC
  - **Problem Statement:** 34% of small business owners abandon setup due to "technical complexity". Maya (Home Baker) wants to sell cakes, not configure DNS or payment gateways.
  - **Research Report:** Based on the rise of Durable (30-second setup), owners prioritize time-to-market. The current OHC setup requires manual domain provisioning and service configuration.
  - **Design Doc:**
    - **Architecture:** `Setup Agent` orchestrating tenant provisioning via KAIROS. Entities: Tenant, Domain Setup Task, Payment Config, Product Profile.
    - **Mobile UX (375px first):** A full-screen conversational interface. A single prompt ("I sell custom cakes on Instagram") generates a preview card of the store. A "Looks Good, Launch" button triggers backend provisioning.
    - **AI Integration:** LLM parses the user prompt into structured JSON configurations for products and branding.
  - **Implementation Prompt:** Create a conversational onboarding flow. Outcome: Maya chats with OHC for 5 minutes. The agent provisions her domain, configures Stripe for custom deposits, and creates her first product from a photo. The Critical User Journey is moving from natural language input to a published product link.
  - **Priority:** P0
  - **Estimated Scope:** Large

  #### Mission 2: Agentic Negotiator & Booker
  - **Title:** Implement Agentic Negotiator & Booker for Service Leads
  - **Problem Statement:** Service businesses lose ~30% of leads because the owner is "on the job" and can't answer calls. Carlos (Field Service) misses leads when busy.
  - **Research Report:** Conversational AI in booking (like 11x.ai Alice) proves that automated inbound handling can recover 25-40% of otherwise lost leads.
  - **Design Doc:**
    - **Architecture:** `Booking Agent` connected to the unified event stream and calendar API. Entities: Lead, Negotiation Thread, Calendar Booking, Deposit Intent.
    - **Mobile UX (375px first):** A feed view showing AI-handled conversations with tags like `[Booked]` or `[Needs Owner Approval]`. Tapping a thread shows the AI transcript.
    - **AI Integration:** Contextual LLM that checks real-time availability and service pricing guidelines before quoting.
  - **Implementation Prompt:** Build an inbound interceptor. Outcome: An AI agent intercepts calls/DMs, checks Carlos's calendar, quotes a price based on project type, and takes a $50 deposit. The CUJ involves an external customer messaging the provided business number and receiving an automated booking link.
  - **Priority:** P1
  - **Estimated Scope:** Medium

  #### Mission 3: Multilingual Order Interceptor
  - **Title:** Implement Multilingual Order Interceptor for High-Volume Fast Casual
  - **Problem Statement:** "I struggle with English-speaking customers on the phone while cooking." (Fatima - Food Cart). Manual translation causes order errors and slowdowns.
  - **Research Report:** 68% of non-native speaker business owners state communication barriers limit their revenue potential. Automated translation tools integrated directly into POS/KDS systems are a major differentiator.
  - **Design Doc:**
    - **Architecture:** `Customer Success Agent` acting as a voice/text gateway. Entities: Raw Order Audio, Translated Text, Structured POS Order.
    - **Mobile UX (375px first):** KDS tablet view with large touch targets. New orders pop up in the native language, showing a small icon indicating it was AI-translated.
    - **AI Integration:** Real-time voice-to-text API (e.g., Whisper) chained to LLM translation and structured JSON extraction for the POS backend.
  - **Implementation Prompt:** Develop an order translation pipeline. Outcome: Agent handles phone orders in English, translates them into Fatima's native language on her tablet KDS. The CUJ is placing a voice order in English and verifying the correct items appear on the KDS in the target language.
  - **Priority:** P2
  - **Estimated Scope:** Medium
