# 🔍 Scout: Tool Integration Research Q2

## [Social Media] Manychat Integration
**Title**: Integrate Manychat for Unified Social Media Inbox
**Problem Statement**: Small business owners like Maya (The Home Baker) receive orders and inquiries across Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Managing these manually is overwhelming and leads to missed sales. They need a single, unified inbox where an AI agent can read and reply to messages from all platforms automatically.
**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Manychat
- **Target Persona**: Maya (Home Baker), Priya (Boutique Owner)
- **Advantages**: Excellent Instagram and WhatsApp API integrations. Robust webhook support for routing messages to OHC's backend. Extremely popular among SMBs for basic automation.
- **Risks**: Pricing scales with contacts, which may be expensive for high-volume, low-margin businesses. Requires Meta business verification for some features.
- **Pricing**: Free tier available (up to 1,000 contacts). Pro tier starts at $15/mo.
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (via webhooks/OAuth). Standalone (would require local reverse proxy for webhooks, possible but complex).
**Design Doc**:
- User goes to the Operations dashboard and clicks "Connect Instagram".
- User authenticates with Facebook/Instagram via OAuth.
- OHC registers webhooks to receive new DMs.
- When a DM arrives, the Customer Success agent reads it, generates a reply (e.g., "Yes, we do vegan cakes!"), and sends it back via Manychat's API.
- The user sees a unified "Customer Inbox" on their phone showing the conversation history.
**Implementation Prompt**: Implement an OAuth flow to connect a user's Instagram/Facebook account via Manychat. Create a webhook endpoint that receives incoming messages, stores them in the unified inbox, and triggers the Customer Success agent to draft a reply.

- **Target Persona**: Carlos (Handyman), Leo (Music Tutor)
