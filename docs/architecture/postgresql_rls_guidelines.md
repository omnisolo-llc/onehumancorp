# PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) Guidelines

## 1. Overview
As the last line of defense in the Cloud architecture, PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) guarantees data isolation. Even in the event of application-layer authorization bypass, the database will refuse to serve data belonging to another tenant.

## 2. Implementation Rules
* **Mandatory RLS**: All tables containing tenant-specific data must have `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`.
* **Context Variable**: RLS policies must read the `app.current_tenant` parameter set during connection initialization.
* **Strict Evaluation**: Policies must evaluate `tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid`.

## 3. Threat Mitigation
* **SQL Injection**: Even if SQL injection occurs, the attacker cannot read outside the boundaries of the initialized `current_tenant` context.
* **Application Bugs**: Broken API filters missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?` will simply return the tenant's data safely filtered by the database engine.

## 4. Connection Lifecycle
* The connection pool MUST discard session state upon release using `DISCARD ALL` to prevent the `app.current_tenant` from bleeding into the next request.

## 5. Audit
* Database schema migrations must be audited by L7 Security engineers to verify RLS enforcement.
