# SQLx Pool Management Best Practices

## 1. Connection Pooling
SQLx provides high-performance asynchronous connection pooling for Rust. However, misconfiguration in multi-tenant environments can lead to catastrophic data leaks.

## 2. After-Release Hooks
* Never rely on the application code to manually clean up session state.
* The connection pool MUST be configured with `.after_release(|conn, _meta| { Box::pin(async move { conn.execute("DISCARD ALL").await }) })`.
* This ensures that temporary tables, prepared statements, and session variables (like `app.current_tenant`) are wiped before the connection is handed to the next request.

## 3. Before-Acquire Hooks
* Avoid using `before_acquire` to set tenant contexts. It is safer to explicitly bind the context in the application query, or set the session variable within the specific transaction scope, reducing the risk of global leakage.

## 4. Timeouts
* Acquire timeouts must be strictly defined (e.g., `acquire_timeout(Duration::from_millis(500))`) to prevent thread starvation under heavy load.

## 5. Connection Limits
* Max connections should be tuned based on the Postgres deployment limits, leaving 10% headroom for administrative and monitoring connections.
