# Zero Trust Thin Client Authentication

## 1. Philosophy
The Thin Client model assumes the local network and the client device itself are potentially compromised. Authentication must be verified continuously and rely on strong cryptographic proofs rather than persistent sessions.

## 2. Access Tokens
* Short-lived JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are the standard bearer tokens.
* Lifespan: Maximum 15 minutes.
* Payload must contain the `x-spiffe-id` binding.

## 3. Token Exchange
* Refresh tokens are stored securely in local secure enclaves.
* Exchanges must be performed over mTLS (Mutual TLS).
* IP pinning and anomaly detection should trigger re-authentication if the client environment drastically changes.

## 4. Hybrid Flow Constraints
* Thin Clients connecting to Cloud APIs must be distinct from Standalone mode instances. Standalone Mode relies on Local IPC and IPC-level trust (via local socket permissions).
* Cloud APIs must validate the JWT signature against the centralized Identity Provider (IdP) JWKS.

## 5. Revocation
* Explicit logout or security breach detection immediately places the JWT ID (JTI) onto a Redis-backed denylist.
