# Multi-Tenant Isolation Principles

## 1. Overview
The OHC Hybrid Agentic OS enforces strict logical and physical separation of tenant data in the Cloud environment. This document outlines the fundamental architectural tenets required to maintain a zero-trust model between organizations using the platform.

## 2. Core Tenets
* **Authentication Context at the Edge**: Tenant identification (`tenant_id`) MUST be resolved securely at the API Gateway via the `x-spiffe-id` header.
* **Strict PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)**: The database layer must implement RLS policies natively ensuring that even if application logic fails, cross-tenant queries return zero rows.
* **Connection Pool Hygiene**: `PgPoolOptions` must be configured with hooks that explicitly execute `DISCARD ALL` after connection release to ensure session state, variables, and context do not leak to the next borrower.

## 3. Implementation Guidelines
* Use `server_auth::parse_spiffe_id` to reliably extract tenant data from `x-spiffe-id`.
* Never trust client-provided headers like `x-tenant-id` directly.
* Bind parameters explicitly in SQL queries: `WHERE tenant_id = $1`.

## 4. Operational Requirements
* All automated tests must cover a "Multi-Tenant Overlap" scenario where concurrent requests from two distinct tenants are validated.
* Metrics and Observability must strictly isolate logs, never exposing one tenant's raw metrics to another.

## 5. Security Remediation Process
* Any vulnerability affecting Multi-Tenant Isolation must be triaged within 1 iteration via the Fast Triage protocol.
* Sentinel (L7) agents hold the ultimate authority to block deployments violating these tenets.
