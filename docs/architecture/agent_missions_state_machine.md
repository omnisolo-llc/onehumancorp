# Agent Missions State Machine Architecture

## 1. Introduction
The `agent_missions` system handles state management for complex Agentic workflows spanning both Cloud and Standalone environments. This document covers the security and operational characteristics of the State Machine.

## 2. Core States
* **PENDING**: The mission is created but execution has not started.
* **RUNNING**: An agent is actively processing the mission. Protected by `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
* **STUCK**: Timeouts or failures resulted in mission stagnation. Needs L7 Sentinel review.
* **FAILED**: Final state after retry exhaustion.
* **COMPLETED**: The mission succeeded.
* **CLOUD_ESCALATION**: Local mission required capabilities beyond Standalone limits; escalated to Cloud.

## 3. Transition Security
* Only authenticated worker nodes bearing a valid `x-spiffe-id` can transition a mission from PENDING to RUNNING.
* Manual state overrides are strictly prohibited via API unless executed by an admin with `Sentinel` privileges.
* Status transitions must be logged in `mission_log` for complete auditability.

## 4. Pruning and Cleanup
* Completed and Failed missions must be periodically pruned from primary transaction tables to avoid unbounded growth.
* Pruning must securely bind the `tenant_id` to ensure one tenant's cleanup job doesn't inadvertently purge another tenant's audit trail.

## 5. Security Posture
* Regular automated fuzzing and chaos engineering validates isolation boundaries.
