# MCP Hybrid Security Considerations

## 1. Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridges Cloud-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) with Local File Systems (FS) and APIs. This introduces significant security complexities that must be managed to prevent Cloud components from improperly accessing local Standalone data.

## 2. Trust Boundaries
* **Cloud**: Untrusted relative to local data. Can only access what the Local Proxy explicitly permits.
* **Local Proxy**: Trusted. Acts as the gatekeeper.

## 3. Security Constraints
* The Local Proxy must never expose root directories (`/` or `C:\`). It must be jailed/chrooted to a specific working directory.
* The Cloud Agent can only issue `read` or `write` commands against paths explicitly mapped in the Local Proxy configuration.
* Path Traversal (`../`) attacks must be actively mitigated at the proxy boundary before being executed.

## 4. Identity Mapping
* The `x-spiffe-id` associated with an MCP connection must uniquely tie to the Standalone user's session.
* Unauthorized Cloud tenants cannot "discover" or ping Local Proxies belonging to other tenants.

## 5. Auditing
* All MCP traffic (Cloud <-> Local) must be logged locally on the Standalone instance for user review, ensuring transparency in what the Agentic OS is doing.
