# Data Residency and Compliance

## 1. Objective
Ensuring OHC meets global regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, SOC2) regarding data storage, processing, and residency.

## 2. Physical Isolation
* Tenants can request deployment in specific geographic regions (e.g., EU-Central, US-East).
* Database clusters are isolated per region. Cross-region replication is strictly disabled for these tenants.

## 3. Logical Isolation
* As outlined in `multi_tenant_isolation_principles.md`, logical isolation is strictly enforced via RLS.

## 4. Data Deletion
* When a tenant deletes an account, an async worker executes a hard delete across all databases.
* `PRAGMA secure_delete = ON` for local SQLite instances ensures deleted rows are immediately overwritten, complying with "Right to be Forgotten" mandates.

## 5. Encryption
* Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 (Cloud EBS volumes and Standalone SQLCipher).
* Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
