# Title: Integrate Hootsuite for Social Media Integration

## Problem Statement
Growing teams need a centralized dashboard to monitor streams of mentions, hashtags, and competitors, but find native apps too limited for collaborative monitoring.
Comprehensive and widely-used social media management suite.
By integrating Hootsuite directly into the OHC platform, we can eliminate the administrative friction that plagues small business owners. Rather than maintaining separate tabs and losing contextual data, the user requires a centralized experience. They demand a simple, secure authorization handshake that immediately syncs their external data with OHC's unified dashboard, bypassing the need for complex API key management.

## Research Report
### Overview
Hootsuite has established itself as a critical player in the Social Media Integration sector. Our comprehensive research indicates that a significant portion of our user base already utilizes this tool. Integrating it will directly address core workflow inefficiencies.

### Competitive Analysis
When positioned against other tools in the market, Hootsuite offers a unique value proposition tailored to its specific audience.
- It excels in providing specialized features that generic tools overlook.
- The platform maintains a high reputation on software review sites like G2 and Capterra.
- It possesses a robust developer ecosystem, ensuring the API is stable enough for our integration needs.

### Advantages and Risks
**Advantages:**
- The stream-based interface allows monitoring many feeds simultaneously.
- Massive ecosystem of third-party app integrations.
- Strong scheduling and bulk upload capabilities.
- Proven reliability serving enterprise clients for over a decade.

**Risks:**
- The interface feels dated compared to newer, visual-first competitors.
- Recent pricing changes have alienated some small business users.
- Can be resource-heavy when running many streams in a browser.

### Pricing Estimate
Professional tier starts around $99/month for 1 user and 10 social accounts.

### Cloud and Standalone Support
- **Cloud Mode**: Full compatibility is achievable via standard OAuth 2.0 flows and inbound webhooks. Our multi-tenant architecture will enforce strict credential isolation, ensuring data privacy across OHC tenants.
- **Standalone Mode**: In environments where inbound webhooks are blocked, the integration must fall back to a secure polling mechanism. Alternatively, users may configure local API tokens directly.

## Design Doc
The integration will be accessible via the "Integrations & Add-ons" marketplace within the OHC dashboard.
- **Trigger**: The business owner clicks "Connect Hootsuite" and completes the standard authorization flow. Upon success, they are redirected back to OHC.
- **Action**: OHC encrypts and stores the integration tokens. A background worker immediately initiates a historical sync (e.g., fetching the last 30 days of data).
- **User View**: A dedicated widget or unified inbox tab will materialize, presenting the Hootsuite data natively. Notifications will be merged into the existing OHC alert feed.
- **Lifecycle**: The system will preemptively refresh OAuth tokens. If a token is revoked, a clear, actionable alert will prompt the user to re-authenticate.

## Implementation Prompt
**User-Facing Outcome:**
As a small business owner, I can securely connect my Hootsuite account to OHC with just a few clicks. Once authorized, my critical operational data seamlessly appears in my OHC dashboard, allowing me to monitor and act on information without leaving the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A distinct integration tile for Hootsuite is present in the UI.
2. The authorization flow securely handles OAuth or token exchange.
3. Upon connection, a clear status indicator (e.g., "Syncing...") is displayed.
4. Relevant external data is accurately mapped to OHC's internal data models.
5. In the event of a sync failure, a non-technical error message guides the user to a solution.
6. The integration operates flawlessly in both Cloud and Standalone topologies.
