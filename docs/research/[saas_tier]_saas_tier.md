### Title
Research Report: Multi-Tenant SaaS Tier Architecture

## Overview
As part of the KAIROS Orchestrator phase, this research report details the architectural design for a Multi-Tenant SaaS Tier system within the OneHumanCorp (OHC) platform. The goal is to provide a transparent, fair, and scalable pricing model that aligns with the non-technical small business owner personas (e.g., Maya, Carlos, Priya).

## Findings
### Competitive Analysis
- **Shopify:** Complex and lacks a free tier.
- **Wix/Squarespace:** Confusing upgrade paths and ad-supported free tiers.
- **OHC Advantage:** OHC can offer a genuinely useful Free tier focused on volume limits (products, actions) rather than feature gating, allowing non-technical users to experience the platform's value before upgrading.

### Tier Structure
The proposed tier structure is:
1.  **Free:** $0/mo. 10 Products, 1 AI Department, 100 AI actions/mo, 500MB Storage, OHC Subdomain.
2.  **Starter:** $9/mo. 100 Products, 3 AI Departments, 1,000 AI actions/mo, 5GB Storage, Custom Domain.
3.  **Pro:** $29/mo. Unlimited Products, 10 AI Departments, Unlimited AI actions, 50GB Storage, Custom Domain + SSL.
4.  **Business:** $79/mo. Unlimited everything, 500GB Storage, Multi-domain.

### Architectural Decisions
1.  **Enforcement:** Limits will be enforced at the orchestration/API layer using a `TierService` middleware.
2.  **Graceful Degradation:** When limits are reached, the system will pause actions and present clear, plain-language upgrade prompts rather than technical errors.
3.  **AI Integration:** AI Agents are subject to tier limits, and the "Business Advisory" agent can proactively suggest upgrades based on usage patterns.
4.  **Billing Sync:** Integration with Stripe webhooks to handle asynchronous tier updates and payment processing.

## Problem Statement
The OHC platform currently lacks a formalized multi-tenant tier system to handle feature and usage limits based on subscription plans. Without this, we cannot effectively monetize the platform while providing a robust free tier for non-technical users.

## Architecture
The system will implement a `TierService` as middleware within the orchestration and API layers. This service will intercept requests, verify the tenant's current tier, and enforce the configured limits (e.g., product count, AI actions). Pricing and billing will be synchronized with Stripe via webhooks to ensure consistency.

## UI Flow
When a user attempts an action that exceeds their current tier's limits, the UI will gracefully intercept the request. Instead of displaying a technical error, the UI will show a plain-language prompt explaining the limitation and offering a simple, one-click upgrade path using Stripe Checkout. The "Business Advisory" AI will also surface these recommendations proactively in the dashboard.

## Implementation Prompt
Implement the Multi-Tenant SaaS Tier Architecture as outlined above. This includes creating the `TierService` middleware, defining the tier structures in the database, integrating with Stripe webhooks for billing sync, and updating the frontend components to handle graceful degradation and upgrade prompts. Ensure all components use OHC premium design tokens and adhere to the mobile-first strategy.
