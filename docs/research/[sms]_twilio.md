## [SMS] Twilio Integration
**Title**: Integrate Twilio for SMS Order Notifications
**Problem Statement**: Fatima (Food Cart Operator) relies on her phone for everything and might miss app push notifications in a noisy environment. She needs reliable SMS alerts when a new pre-order arrives so she can start cooking.
**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Twilio
- **Target Persona**: Fatima (Food Cart Operator)
- **Advantages**: Global coverage, incredibly reliable. Programmable messaging.
- **Risks**: A2P 10DLC compliance in the US is complex and requires business registration, which might be a barrier for informal businesses.
- **Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go (~$0.0079 per SMS in US).
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (Centralized OHC Twilio account). Standalone (User provides API key).
**Design Doc**:
- User goes to Settings and toggles "Send me SMS for new orders".
- When an order is paid, the Operations agent triggers a Twilio API call to send an SMS: "New order! 2x Falafel for John. Pickup in 15m."
- (Future: Customers can also receive SMS receipts).
**Implementation Prompt**: Integrate the Twilio SDK to send outbound SMS notifications. Add a setting for the business owner to opt-in to SMS alerts for new orders. Ensure compliance with local messaging regulations.
**Priority**: P2
**Estimated Scope**: Medium
