## [Video] Zoom Integration
**Title**: Integrate Zoom for Auto-Generated Meeting Links
**Problem Statement**: Leo (Music Tutor) manually creates a Zoom link for every new lesson and emails it to the student. This is prone to error and looks unprofessional. He needs links to be generated automatically when a lesson is booked.
**Research Report**:
- **Tool**: Zoom
- **Target Persona**: Leo (Music Tutor)
- **Advantages**: Ubiquitous for online lessons. Strong API for meeting creation.
- **Risks**: Zoom OAuth requires annual app review and compliance checks.
- **Pricing**: Free tier (40-min limit). Pro starts at $15/mo.
- **Compatibility**: Cloud (OAuth). Standalone (Server-to-Server OAuth).
**Design Doc**:
- User connects their Zoom account via the Sales dashboard.
- When a customer books an online service (e.g., via Calendly or native booking), OHC calls the Zoom API to create a meeting.
- The Zoom link is embedded in the automated calendar invite and confirmation email sent to the customer.
**Implementation Prompt**: Create an OAuth integration with Zoom. Automatically generate a unique Zoom meeting link when a customer books a virtual service, and include this link in the customer's confirmation email.
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated Scope**: Medium
