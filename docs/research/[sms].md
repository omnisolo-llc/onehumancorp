# Title: Integrate SMS & Notifications for OHC Business Owners

## Problem Statement
Many customers prefer SMS over email. Owners need a reliable way to send order updates via text.

## Research Report
Twilio is robust but hard to set up for non-devs. MessageBird is another option. OHC needs to abstract the SMS provider.

### Persona Alignment
Small business owners, especially those with limited technical proficiency, require tools that work out-of-the-box. The evaluation of these sms & notifications solutions emphasized zero-configuration setups, transparent pricing models, and high reliability. The primary goal is to reduce cognitive load and administrative overhead.

### Market Context
The market for sms & notifications solutions is crowded, yet highly fragmented. Competitors often target enterprise users, leaving micro-businesses underserved. By providing a native, seamless sms & notifications experience within OHC, we can significantly increase user retention and satisfaction.

## Design Doc
Users buy SMS credits or connect their Twilio account. Automated triggers (e.g. Order Shipped) send SMS.

### Integration Architecture
- **Triggers**: User actions within OHC (e.g., connecting an account, receiving an order, booking an appointment) trigger the integration.
- **Actions**: The system orchestrates API calls or webhook events to synchronize state between OHC and the external sms & notifications provider.
- **User Interface**: All complex configurations are abstracted. The user interacts only with high-level business concepts (e.g., 'Send Message', 'Create Appointment').

## Implementation Prompt
**User-Facing Outcome:**
The business owner experiences a seamless sms & notifications workflow entirely within the OHC platform. They do not need to manage external credentials continuously or switch context between applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Integration can be enabled/disabled via a single toggle or OAuth flow in settings.
- [ ] Core sms & notifications data is visible and actionable within the primary OHC dashboard.
- [ ] The feature functions correctly in both Cloud (multi-tenant) and Standalone environments.
- [ ] Error states (e.g., API rate limits, authentication failures) are handled gracefully with clear, actionable user messages.

### Detailed Research Note 1 for SMS & Notifications
In evaluating the broader implications of sms & notifications, it is evident that small businesses operating in resource-constrained environments highly value automation. The integration must ensure that data flows seamlessly without manual intervention. Security, particularly around OAuth tokens and customer PII, must be handled securely by OHC's backend, adhering to Zero Secrets mandates where applicable.

Furthermore, considering the diverse user base, the sms & notifications solution must be accessible, complying with WCAG standards and supporting responsive design principles (mobile-first, perfectly usable at 375px viewport). The performance impact on the client side should be negligible, with entrance animations keeping within the 300ms budget.
