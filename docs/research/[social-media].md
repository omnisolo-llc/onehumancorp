# Title: Integrate Social Media Integration for OHC Business Owners

## Problem Statement
Small business owners waste hours checking Instagram DMs, Facebook comments, WhatsApp, and TikTok separately. Missing a message means losing a sale. They need a unified inbox.

## Research Report
We evaluated ManyChat, Chatfuel, and Meta Business Suite. ManyChat offers great Instagram/FB integration but has a steep learning curve. Chatfuel is good for WhatsApp. A unified webhook-based OHC inbox connecting via official APIs is best.

### Persona Alignment
Small business owners, especially those with limited technical proficiency, require tools that work out-of-the-box. The evaluation of these social media integration solutions emphasized zero-configuration setups, transparent pricing models, and high reliability. The primary goal is to reduce cognitive load and administrative overhead.

### Market Context
The market for social media integration solutions is crowded, yet highly fragmented. Competitors often target enterprise users, leaving micro-businesses underserved. By providing a native, seamless social media integration experience within OHC, we can significantly increase user retention and satisfaction.

## Design Doc
OAuth connection page in settings. Webhooks listen for incoming messages. Unified inbox UI in OHC where users can reply directly.

### Integration Architecture
- **Triggers**: User actions within OHC (e.g., connecting an account, receiving an order, booking an appointment) trigger the integration.
- **Actions**: The system orchestrates API calls or webhook events to synchronize state between OHC and the external social media integration provider.
- **User Interface**: All complex configurations are abstracted. The user interacts only with high-level business concepts (e.g., 'Send Message', 'Create Appointment').

## Implementation Prompt
**User-Facing Outcome:**
The business owner experiences a seamless social media integration workflow entirely within the OHC platform. They do not need to manage external credentials continuously or switch context between applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Integration can be enabled/disabled via a single toggle or OAuth flow in settings.
- [ ] Core social media integration data is visible and actionable within the primary OHC dashboard.
- [ ] The feature functions correctly in both Cloud (multi-tenant) and Standalone environments.
- [ ] Error states (e.g., API rate limits, authentication failures) are handled gracefully with clear, actionable user messages.
