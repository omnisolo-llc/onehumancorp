# Accept Buy-Now-Pay-Later via Klarna

## 1. Problem Statement
For high-ticket services or products, customers often abandon carts because they cannot pay upfront. Buy-Now-Pay-Later increases average order value.

This issue represents a significant friction point for our core demographic. The inability to seamlessly manage this aspect of their business leads to tangible revenue loss and operational inefficiency. Small business owners are not IT administrators; they expect their tools to communicate flawlessly without requiring manual intervention or complex configuration screens.

## 2. Research Report
Klarna integration allows customers to split payments while the business gets paid upfront. Very popular in Europe and growing in the US.

### Market Validation
Our market analysis confirms that competitors either lack this integration entirely or place it behind expensive enterprise tiers. By offering this seamlessly within OHC, we create a strong competitive moat. It directly appeals to businesses scaling past their first phase of growth who are beginning to feel the pain of fragmented systems.

### Technical Feasibility Assessment
The third-party APIs required to support this are generally stable and well-documented. We anticipate standard challenges regarding rate limiting and token expiration, which must be handled gracefully by our backend worker queues. The implementation will rely on our standard asynchronous event processing model to ensure the core application remains highly responsive.


### Pricing & Deployment
- **Pricing Estimate:** Freemium tier available; standard API usage rates apply thereafter.
- **Deployment Compatibility:** Fully functional in both Cloud (multi-tenant) and Standalone (local instance) modes.

## 3. Design Document
Enable Klarna in settings. Show 'Pay in 4' options dynamically on the checkout page.

### User Experience Considerations
The 'Grandmother Test' is critical here. The connection flow must avoid technical jargon. We cannot ask users to configure 'webhooks' or 'callback URLs'. The entire process must be a simple OAuth click-through or a very well-guided wizard with clear screenshots and tooltips.

## 4. Implementation Prompt
Integrate Klarna SDK into the checkout flow. Display installment estimates on the product/service detail pages.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The user can initiate and complete the connection flow in under 3 minutes.
2. The unified dashboard accurately reflects the new data without requiring a manual page refresh.
3. If the connection fails or the token expires, a clear, actionable alert is displayed to the user.
4. The feature passes all Playwright E2E tests for the core happy path.
