# Integrate Shippo for Automated Label Generation

## Problem Statement
E-commerce and retail users spend an inordinate amount of time manually comparing shipping rates across different carriers and printing labels one by one. This manual process limits their ability to scale order fulfillment.
Small business owners frequently report that managing multiple disconnected tools is their biggest operational bottleneck. They lack the time, budget, and technical expertise to integrate complex enterprise systems. A unified, automated approach is required to let them focus on their core business activities rather than software administration. The current disconnected state leads to lost leads, missed appointments, and frustrated customers.

Furthermore, there is a mental toll in context switching between 5-10 different apps a day. It is highly error-prone. A missed notification in one tool can lead to a cascading failure in customer service. This integration directly addresses the friction of operating a small scale business in the modern digital age, moving away from fragmented single-purpose tools to a more unified 'Agentic OS' paradigm that One Human Corp provides.

### Impact Analysis
1. **Time Saved:** Automating this workflow is expected to save the average business owner between 5 to 10 hours per week.
2. **Error Reduction:** Direct integration eliminates manual data entry, reducing copy-paste errors by nearly 100%.
3. **Customer Satisfaction:** Faster response times and fewer missed interactions directly correlate with higher customer retention and better reviews.
4. **Cognitive Load:** By centralizing operations, the owner experiences less decision fatigue and stress associated with monitoring multiple platforms.
5. **Data Sovereignty:** By pulling data into OHC, the owner gains better control and holistic reporting over their business metrics compared to data isolated in third-party silos.
6. **Financial Impact:** Reduced software subscriptions (by replacing disparate point solutions) and recovered lost revenue from missed communications.
7. **Scale Readiness:** Foundations built here allow for 'Autonomous Background Agents' to take actions on behalf of the user in the future, unlocking significant future value.


## Research Report
Shippo provides a unified API that connects to dozens of global carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc.). It abstracts the complexity of individual carrier APIs and offers discounted shipping rates directly to the user.

### In-Depth Market Context
The market for SMB software is highly fragmented. Solutions often cater to either the lower end (very simple, lacking APIs) or the upper end (enterprise, complex, expensive). The chosen tool occupies the sweet spot: accessible for SMBs but with robust integration capabilities.
Our primary personas (e.g., local service providers, solo consultants, boutique retail) need solutions that require zero technical maintenance once set up.

### Specific Research Findings for this Category
Alternatives like EasyPost were considered, but Shippo's interface and out-of-the-box discounted rates make it slightly more appealing for the non-technical SMB owner who doesn't want to negotiate their own carrier rates.

Use Case Focus: An artisanal soap maker gets 20 orders over the weekend. Instead of going to the post office website 20 times, they click 'Fulfill via Shippo' in OHC and print 20 discounted labels in 5 minutes.

### Competitive Landscape and Alternatives Analyzed
We conducted a thorough evaluation of the alternatives:
1. **Alternative 1 (Enterprise-Focused):** While feature-rich, this option required significant upfront configuration, often mandating an onboarding call. The pricing scaled aggressively with usage, making it unsuitable for our target demographic of cost-conscious SMBs. Furthermore, the API documentation was gated.
2. **Alternative 2 (Low-End / Consumer-Focused):** This alternative was highly accessible and often free, but it lacked the necessary webhook support and programmatic controls required for deep integration into OHC's Hybrid OS. It functioned too much as a 'walled garden'.
3. **The Selected Tool:** Demonstrated the best combination of transparent pricing, extensive documentation, responsive developer support, and a user experience that our core demographic is already familiar with.

### Security and Privacy Audit
From a non-technical user's perspective, data security is paramount even if they don't understand the underlying mechanics. The selected tool complies with standard data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA where applicable). Integration via OAuth ensures that OHC never directly handles user passwords. All data in transit is secured via TLS 1.2+. Data at rest within OHC will be subject to our existing row-level security and encryption protocols. Furthermore, any locally cached data in Standalone mode will be encrypted via go-sqlcipher with secure 0600 file permissions.

### Cloud vs Standalone Capability Matrix
- **Cloud (Multi-tenant):** Full compatibility. Webhooks can be reliably delivered to OHC's cloud endpoints. OAuth flows work seamlessly with cloud redirect URIs. Rate limiting is managed at the platform level via Redis-backed counters.
- **Standalone (Local/Desktop):** High compatibility. Outbound API calls from the local desktop client to the tool work perfectly. For inbound events (webhooks), we must architect a solution that either relies on long-polling from the client, or utilizes an optional cloud-relay service provided by OHC to bridge the gap to the local network. This is a critical architectural requirement for true hybrid operation.


## Design Doc
When a user views an order in OHC, the backend will query the Shippo API with the package dimensions and destination to retrieve real-time shipping rates. The user selects a rate, and OHC calls Shippo to purchase and generate the PDF shipping label. Tracking data is saved to the OHC order record.

### Architectural Overview & Data Flow
The integration will utilize a standard event-driven architecture to ensure OHC remains responsive and fault-tolerant.

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - User navigates to the 'Integrations' panel within their OHC dashboard.
   - User clicks 'Connect' for the respective service.
   - OHC initiates an OAuth 2.0 flow (or prompts for secure API key entry if OAuth is unavailable for this specific tool).
   - Upon successful authorization, access and refresh tokens are securely stored (encrypted at rest in PostgreSQL for Cloud mode, or within the encrypted SQLite SIPDB for Standalone mode).

2. **Data Ingestion (Inbound Events):**
   - The third-party tool generates an event based on user or customer action.
   - An HTTP POST request (webhook payload) is sent to OHC's configured webhook listener endpoint.
   - OHC verifies the webhook signature using the configured shared secret to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing.
   - The payload is parsed, validated against our internal schemas, and normalized into standard OHC internal models.
   - Real-time updates are pushed to the user's active UI session via WebSockets, ensuring they see the new data immediately without refreshing the page.

3. **Action Execution (Outbound Requests):**
   - The user performs an action in the OHC UI (e.g., clicking 'Approve', sending a message).
   - OHC translates this UI action into the appropriate REST API payload required by the third-party service.
   - OHC dispatches the call asynchronously via the background task queue.
   - The system handles rate limits, temporary network failures, and 5xx errors by employing an exponential backoff and retry strategy.

4. **Error Handling & State Synchronization:**
   - If an integration falls out of sync (e.g., missed webhooks during downtime), OHC will initiate a background reconciliation job upon startup or at daily intervals to fetch missing state.
   - Token expiration events will automatically attempt a silent refresh. If that fails, the user will be notified in the UI to re-authenticate.
   - Detailed audit logs are maintained for all cross-platform synchronization events.

5. **Entity Mapping Strategy:**
   - External IDs will be mapped to internal UUIDs via a dedicated `integration_mappings` table to allow robust bi-directional sync without tight coupling.
   - Soft deletes will be utilized when a linked entity is removed in the third-party system to maintain historical audit trails.


## Implementation Prompt
Build a 'Fulfillment' UI component on the order details page. Integrate the rate-fetching and label-purchasing API calls. Automatically download the generated PDF label for printing. Trigger an automated email to the customer containing the Shippo tracking link.

### User Experience (UX) Considerations & Design Principles
- **Zero-Jargon Interface:** The settings page must strictly avoid terms like 'Webhooks', 'REST API', 'Endpoints', or 'OAuth'. Use business-friendly phrases like 'Automatic Sync', 'Connection Status', and 'Real-time Updates'. This adheres to the 'Plain Language Only' constraint.
- **Frictionless Onboarding:** The connection process should ideally be a single click (OAuth flow). If manual configuration is unavoidable, provide a clear, step-by-step visual guide with screenshots indicating exactly where to find the required credentials.
- **Clear State Visibility:** The user should always know the status of the connection at a glance. Provide clear visual indicators (e.g., a green dot and 'Connected' text; a red dot with actionable advice like 'Connection lost. Click here to re-link your account').
- **Graceful Error Handling:** If the third-party service experiences an outage, OHC must not crash or display raw JSON error codes. Instead, display a friendly, empathetic message: "We're having trouble connecting to [Tool Name] right now. We'll keep trying in the background so you don't have to worry."
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide advanced configuration options (like manual sync triggers, detailed logs, or fine-grained event filtering) by default to avoid overwhelming the non-technical user. Allow power users to toggle an 'Advanced Settings' view.
- **Accessibility:** All UI components associated with this integration must pass WCAG AA standards, including proper ARIA labels, contrast ratios, and keyboard navigability.

### Onboarding UX Flow
1. In 'Fulfillment Settings', user clicks 'Connect Shippo'.
2. Standard OAuth flow.
3. Upon connection, user is prompted to set their default 'Ship From' address and preferred box sizes to speed up future label generation.

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria
