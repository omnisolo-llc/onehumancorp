# OHC Help Portal: Visual Walkthroughs

Welcome to the One Human Corp Help Portal. This guide will walk you through setting up and orchestrating your swarm of agents seamlessly across the Hybrid Architecture.

## 1. Getting Started Flow

Follow these steps to unleash the power of the OHC Swarm:

    participant Hub as Orchestration Hub
    participant Agents as Swarm Agents

    CEO->>Hub: 1. Initialize Hybrid Architecture (Cloud/Standalone)
    Hub-->>CEO: Environment Ready
    CEO->>Hub: 2. Hire Agents via /api/agents/hire
    Hub->>Agents: Onboard via SPIFFE Identity
    Agents-->>Hub: Ready
    CEO->>Hub: 3. Create Virtual Meeting Room
    Hub->>Agents: Invite PM & Engineering Director
    Agents-->>CEO: Deliberation Started
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Initialize the Orchestration Hub**
   Start by configuring your base environment. The system operates on the `OHC-HA` (Hybrid Architecture). Use the setup CLI (`ohc_hybrid_cli.sh`) or manually configure your `.env` to select between Cloud, Headless, or Standalone modes.

2. **Hiring Agents**
   Use the UI dashboard or the API to assemble your team. Agents are automatically onboarded using zero-trust SPIFFE identity protocols, ensuring secure communication and delegation.

3. **Virtual Meeting Rooms**
   Initiate a session by inviting the PM and Engineering Director agents to a Virtual Meeting Room. They will use the UltraPlan protocol to debate the scope before executing any code.

## 2. Interactive Agent Status Dashboard

Keep track of your swarm via the Teammate Mesh realtime updates. The dashboard uses Centrifuge (`mesh:tasks`) to reflect the exact status of your delegation hierarchy.

    Director --> |Sub-Task| SWE[Software Engineer]
    Director --> |Sub-Task| QA[QA Tester]

    class Task,Director,SWE,QA premium;
```

## 3. Troubleshooting

- **Redis Connections in Standalone Mode**: In Standalone mode, OHC falls back gracefully to SQLite. Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for your local sqlite database rather than a remote Postgres instance.
- **Teammate Mesh Not Syncing**: Verify the connection to the Centrifuge realtime pub/sub system and ensure your client is subscribed to the `mesh:tasks` channels. Check the network logs for any 401 Unauthorized errors indicating token expiration.
